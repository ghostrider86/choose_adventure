# choose_adventure
My goal is to be a great software engineer, which requires continually study and practice. To accomplish this, I need to stretch myself with new languages and to learn more in depth languages I already have a grasp on. So as with each new program I right I get closer and closer to my goal and get more of an appreciation for programming. This project is a choose your own adventure game, it has a couple stories to start with. Where the user can pick or choose which one or both that he/she wants to go through. The program asks for user input and remembers the choices the player made and gives them varying choices accordingly. I wrote this to further enhance my knowledge of python and since I enjoy games, Iâ€™ve tried to make each project of mine based on a game.
